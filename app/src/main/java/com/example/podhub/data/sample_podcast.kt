I‚Äôve been sitting in a space of reflection lately, trying to make sense of the before and after of my life. Not the shiny, curated ‚Äúbefore and after‚Äù you see in gym photos‚Ä¶ but the emotional, soul-level shift of what happens when you stop living a life that looks good on the outside and start living one that <em>feels</em> right on the inside.</p><p>In this episode, I‚Äôm sharing what it was really like to come out late in life, not just as a lesbian, but as <em>me</em>. What it felt like to live a life that ticked all the boxes but left me feeling empty, bone-tired, and disconnected from my own skin. I talk about the anger I carried, the shame I buried, and the constant push to be someone I wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ all in the hope of being accepted.</p><p>But I also talk about the shift. The grief and fear that came with unraveling that life. The slow, quiet moments of stepping into my truth. And the lightness‚Äîoh my god, the <em>relief</em>‚Äîthat followed.</p><p>This is for you if you‚Äôve ever found yourself wondering, ‚ÄúWhat if I built my whole life being someone I‚Äôm not?‚Äù If you‚Äôre in that <em>before</em> stage, where something doesn‚Äôt quite fit and you can‚Äôt unsee it anymore. Or if you‚Äôve already started that journey and you‚Äôre navigating the messy middle. You‚Äôre not too late. You‚Äôre not broken. And you‚Äôre not selfish for wanting more.</p><p>I hope this episode reminds you that you‚Äôre allowed to change. You‚Äôre allowed to grow.

For the past five years, Jo has served as the LGBTQIA+ liaison, building crucial bridges between law enforcement and the queer community. With 18 years on the force, she brings unique perspective to her role: &quot;Behind the badge is a human being who cares deeply.&quot; Jo discusses how her position allows her to advocate for community members while helping transform perceptions within the department. Her selection as Grand Marshal represents both personal validation and institutional progress.<br/><br/>Lauren Tennyson takes us inside the First Christian Church of Katy, where radical inclusivity is reshaping suburban ministry. As Outreach Director, Lauren oversees their &quot;transparent closet,&quot; providing clothing and resources to LGBTQ+ youth in need. The church has earned recognition as Outsmart Magazine&apos;s favorite trans support organization through their commitment to creating safe spaces outside the Loop. Lauren invites listeners to their upcoming Pride events, including drag bingo fundraisers on June 7th and a special Pride Sunday service featuring a trans male preacher sharing his journey.<br/><br/>We close with Derek Charles Livingston, artistic director of Stages Houston, discussing his direction of the world premiere &quot;Let Her Rip.&quot; This innovative production weaves together two historical threads ‚Äì the Jack the Ripper murders and the matchstick maker strike of 1888 ‚Äì to examine ongoing violence against marginalized women. The parallels to contemporary issues, including violence against trans women of color, make this a particularly powerful Pride Month offering. Derek also shares exciting plans for Stages&apos; upcoming season, featuring diverse voices and stories.<br/><br/>Don&apos;t miss the Houston Pride Parade on June 28th!

As a kid, Carter often escaped into art and video games, but everything changed when he discovered drag and body mods. These helped him start embracing who he really is. He opens up about the tough times he faced while rebuilding relationships with his family, especially his dad and brother, and how being open and vulnerable has played a crucial role in that process. We also get to witness Carter&apos;s heartfelt proposal to his partner, Taylor, and see how their love has been a major source of support for him. Through his story, Carter shows us the power of staying true to yourself and the importance of having genuine connections in your life.<br/><br/>Tune in now on Spotify and YouTube to hear Carter&apos;s heartfelt story of self-acceptance and personal growth:<br/><br/>https://youtu.be/0YqDlCMbbbw<br/><br/>Are you ready to share your Pride Story?¬† Visit https://wetellwell.com/pride-stories-podcast to learn more.<br/><br/>FOLLOW US!<br/>Website: <a href='http://www.wetellwell.com/'>wetellwell.com</a><br/>Instagram: <a href='https://www.instagram.com/wetellwell/'>@wetellwell</a><br/>Facebook: <a href='https://www.facebook.com/wetellwell'>facebook.com/wetellwell</a></p>",
